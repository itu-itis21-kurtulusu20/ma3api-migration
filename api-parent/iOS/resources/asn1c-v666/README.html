  <h2><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Thank you for downloading this release of the ASN1C software. ASN1C is
    a powerful ASN.1 compiler capable of parsing and generating C, C++, C#,
    or Java source code for the most advanced ASN.1 syntax.

    <p>This package contains the ASN1C compiler executables and run-time
    libraries. Documentation is available online at <a href=
    "http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/documents.shtml">http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/documents.shtml</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="WhatsNew" id="WhatsNew"></a>Release Notes</h2>

  <blockquote>
    This release of ASN1C adds the following new capabilities:

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Capability to Encode/Decode Data in JSON Format</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The capability to generate encoders/decoders that support
          Javascript Object Notation (JSON) has been added.  JSON is a 
          reasonably simple and compact textual encoding format that is 
          now being used in many domains where XML was used before.
          No formal encoding rule specification exists for JSON, so 
          we created our own.  The document is available 
          at <a href="http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/JSONEncodingRules.pdf">
          http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/JSONEncodingRules.pdf</a></p>
      </dd>
    
      <dt><b>Capability to Encode/Decode 3GPP Layer 3 Messages</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The capability to encode/decode binary 3GPP layer 3 messages
          has been added.  These include messages specified in the 
          Non-Access Stratum (NAS) layer for 3G and LTE.  These messages 
          are not specified in ASN.1 but rather in tabular format and 
          using Concrete Syntax Notation 1 (CSN.1).  However, it was 
          determined that a fairly close approximation of the messages 
          could be created in ASN.1 along with a special encoding rules 
          capability (3G Layer 3) and additional configuration directives
          to refine the encoding format.  A document on the approach used
          to work with these message types is available at 
          <a href="http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/UsingASNtoDescribe3GPPMessages.pdf">
          http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/UsingASNtoDescribe3GPPMessages.pdf</a></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Open Source Version of C BER/DER Run-time</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>An open source version of the C BER/DER run-time (ooberrt) has
          been added.  This is a limited version of our BER/DER run-time 
          that does not contain all features and is not fully optimized as 
          is our commercial version.  Nonetheless, it may be sufficient 
          for some applications.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Capability to Embed Configuration Directives in  ASN.1 Comments</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>An external XML file was the only method available up until this
          release to apply configuration directives to specific ASN.1 types
          or elements.  It is now possible to embed directives as special 
          ASN.1 comments immediately precding the item to be configured.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Addition of ASN.1 Comments and Type Definitions in C/C++ Header Files</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>ASN.1 comments as well as the ASN.1 definition itself are now 
          embedded as comments in generated C/C++ header files for each 
          generated C/C++ type or class.  This makes it easy to see the 
          ASN.1 definition a generated C structure represents.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>More Efficient Table Constraint Index Handling</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Modified C/C++ code generation of SEQUENCE-based index values 
          in table constraints to be more efficient (replaced if-else with 
          switch at each level).</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Option to Use Enumerated Types in C/C++ Code</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A new command-line option, -use-enum-types, has been added which 
          replaces the integer types that were used to represent enumerated 
          types with generated enum types.  Integers were always used in 
          the past because the size was known (different C compilers 
          generated different sized items for enum types) and to account 
          for the possibility of unknown extensible enumerated items. 
          This option allows the user to override this behavior and use 
          the enum type instead.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Added support for ASN.1 2008 IRI Type</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Support was added for the ASN.1 2008 IRI Type for all 
          languages.  ASN1C now supports all items in the ASN.1 2008
          standard with the exception of some Extended-XER encoding 
          instructions.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Addition of hashCode Method in Java</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A hashCode method is now generated in all Java classed when 
          the -compare command-line qualifier is specified.</p>
      </dd>

  <h2><a name="CodeGenChanges" id="CodeGenChanges"></a>Compatibility</h2>

  <blockquote>
    In an ongoing effort to improve the product, changes have been made in
    how code is generated in some cases. The following are known areas
    where differences with the previous version exist:

    <ol>
      <li>The format of the enumerated type used to represent CHOICE 
        tag constants was changed when the -use-enum-types directive 
        is used.  The enum type is now embedded directly in the 
        generated structure as has a tag value of T (i.e. enum T).
        It was only possible to generate this type of constant before 
        using the undocumented -enumchoice option, so this change should 
        not impact many users.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h2><a name="Documentation" id="Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Documentation for release is available online at the following
    web-link:

  <h2><a name="UnixInstall" id="UnixInstall"></a>UNIX/Linux
  Installation</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The steps to install ASN1C on a UNIX or Linux system are as
    follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download the ASN1C package that is of interest to you. Packages
      are available online for Solaris (Sparc and x86), HP-UX (IA64 and
      PA-RISC), Linux (x86 and x64), and Mac OSX operating systems. There
      are different C/C++ versions of these packages containing run-time
      libraries built with GNU gcc/g++ or native compilers. There is also a
      Java package available for each of these operating systems.</li>

      <li>ASN1C for UNIX/Linux is packaged in a gzipped .tar file. To
      install, unzip the file (gunzip) and untar (tar xf) in any directory.
      Note that in order to run the sample programs, write access to the
      sample directories is required, so make sure that you have write
      access to the base directory where the compiler is installed.</li>

      <li>After installation is complete, the license for the product must
        be installed.  This can come in two forms - as a license file 
        or a license key value:

        <dl>
          <dt>If a license file was provided either on the user's download 
            page or as an E-mail attachment, this file should be copied to 
            the same directory that the ASN1C compiler executable file is 
            located in. This is in the bin subdirectory located under the 
            top-level install directory.</dt>

          <dt>Alternately, a license key value may have been provided for 
            product activation.  This can be used either through the GUI 
            interface by following the on-screen instructions, or by running
            ASN1C from the command-line using the <tt>-lickey</tt> switch.</dt>
        </dl>

        <p>The compiler should now be operational. The following command
        can be executed:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <tt>&lt;rootdir&gt;/bin/asn1c</tt>
        </blockquote>

        <p>to verify operation.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    The following subdirectories contain the following files (note:
    <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;</tt> refers to the installation directory that
    was specified during the installation process):

    <h3>Base Compiler Package</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/asn1c</tt></dt>

      <dd>The command-line compiler executable file. This is invoked on
      ASN.1 or XSD source files to generate C, C++, C#, or Java
      encode/decode classes and functions. It is recommended you modify
      your PATH environment variable to include
      <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin</tt> to allow the compiler executable to
      be run from anywhere.</dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/asn1cgui</tt></dt>

      <dd>The compiler graphic user interface (GUI) wizard executable file.
      This GUI guides a user through the process of specifying ASN.1 or XSD
      source files and options. (Note: this binary is currently only
      available on Linux and Solaris systems. Source code is available to
      build it on other UNIX systems).</dd>

      &lt;installdir&gt;/bin/ber2indef</tt></dt>

      <dd>Utility programs for operating on BER-encoded files. The first
      program allows a file to be dumped in a human-readable format. The
      other two utilities convert files from the use of indefinite to
      definite length encoding and vice-versa.</dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/dumpasn1</tt></dt>

      <dd>A public-domain ASN.1 BER/DER encoded data dump tool. Thanks to
      Peter Gutmann for making this available for public use. The full
      source code for this program can be found in the utils subdirectory
      of the installation.</dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/xsd2asn1</tt></dt>

      <dd>XSD-to-ASN.1 translation program executable file. This programs

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/scripts</tt></dt>

      <dd>This directory contains Perl script files for doing source code
      editing and other transformations. The <i>rtport.pl</i> script is
      included in this release to port existing C/C++ applications that use
      ASN1C generated code from version 5.8 or lower to be compatible with
      the latest release of the product.</dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/utils</tt></dt>

      <dd>This directory contains the source code and build makefile for
      some of the utility programs included in the bin subdirectory.</dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/xsd/lib/asn1.xsd</tt></dt>

      <dd>This directory contains the common XML schema definitions (XSD)
      library. This contains type mappings for built-in ASN.1 types that do

    The compiler must be run from a command shell prompt. The sample
    progams were developed using the bash shell and should be compatible
    with the sh and ksh shells. Users of the C-shell (csh) will probably
    need to make some modifications.

    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Execute the <tt>make</tt> utility program:

        <p><tt>make</tt></p>

        <p>This should cause the compiler to be invoked to compile the
        <tt>employee.asn</tt> sample file. It will then invoke the C or C++
        compiler to compile the generated C file and the test drivers. The
        result should be a <tt>writer</tt> and <tt>reader</tt> program file
        which, when invoked, will encode and decode a sample employee
        record.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Invoke writer from the command line:

        <p><tt>writer</tt></p>

        <p>This will generate an encoded record and write it to a disk
        file. By default, the file generated is <i>message.dat</i> (in the
        case of XER, it is <i>message.xml</i>). The test program has a
        number of command line switches that control the encoding. To view
        the switches, enter <i>writer ?</i> and a usage display will be
        shown.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Invoke reader from the command line:

        <p><tt>reader</tt></p>

        <p>This will read the disk file that was just created by the writer
        program and decode its contents. The resulting decoded data will be
        written to standard output. The test program has a number of
        command line switches that control the encoding. To view the
        switches, enter <i>reader ?</i> and a usage display will be
