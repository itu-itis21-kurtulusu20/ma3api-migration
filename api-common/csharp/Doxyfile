# Doxyfile 1.7.3

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

# Project related configuration options

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file 
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all 
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the 
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See 
# http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for the list of possible encodings.

@INCLUDE_PATH = ./csharp
@INCLUDE = DoxyfileCommon


# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = ma3api-common


# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the CHM_FILE tag can 
# be used to specify the file name of the resulting .chm file. You 
# can add a path in front of the file if the result should not be 
# written to the html output directory.

CHM_FILE               = ../ma3api-common.chm
