The present document specifies the use of container structures, to bind
together a number of signed objects (e.g. documents, XML structured data,
spreadsheet, multimedia content) with either detached advanced electronic
signatures or time-stamp tokens into one single digital container based on
ZIP [8] and supporting the following signature and time-stamp token formats:

• CAdES (TS 101 733 [1]);
• XAdES (TS 101 903 [2]);
• RFC 3161 [3] time-stamp tokens.
